## My process
- I looked throught the design template critically and planned how I would execute my project
- I structured my content with HTML
-I created variables for styling my project 
-I added styles to the top of the page and worked down.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- CSS Custom Properties


### What I learned

-I learnt how to use the CSS Ffexbox property and media query to design the template for mobile screen. 
-I learnt how to embed an icon inside a button. I also learnt how to add spacing between the icon and the text using the padding property.
-I learnt how to add space between words using the word spacing property.
-I learnt how to apply the max-width and max-height.
Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.


### Continued development

I would like to focus on getting better at applying margins. It was quite challenging  trying to center my container. I was also unable to figure out the exact font that was used in designing the template. I had trouble figuring out the interactive elements.



### Useful resources

- https://stackoverflow.com/questions/34393465/add-svg-icon-into-button-with-css-html - This helped me add the cart icon within my button as a picture. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
-https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10995294/border-radius-not-working - This is an amazing article which helped me understand while i could not add border radius to my container. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
